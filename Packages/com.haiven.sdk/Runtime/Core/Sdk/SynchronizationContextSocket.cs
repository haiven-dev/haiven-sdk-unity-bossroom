    /// This is the <c>dispatch.sync-context</c> adapter from the engine-quirks
    /// plan, written once by hand until the effect interpreter is generated. It
    /// exists because <see cref="SystemNetSocket"/> raises every event from its
    /// receive loop, and a host whose scene API is main-thread-only (Unity) has
    /// to be handed events on that thread. Putting the marshalling in a
    /// decorator keeps the transport host-neutral, which is the reason
    /// <see cref="SystemNetSocket"/> gives for not doing it itself.
    ///
    /// Every event is <b>posted</b>, even when it is raised on the context
    /// already. Posting is FIFO on the contexts that matter (Unity's drains a
    /// queue once per frame), so a frame and the close that follows it keep their
    /// order; invoking inline when "already there" would let a close overtake
    /// frames still queued. Events still queued when the socket is disposed are
    /// dropped: a disposed socket has no listener that expects them.
