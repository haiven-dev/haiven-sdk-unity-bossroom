// The question this file exists to answer is narrow: the two outbound shapes are
// discriminated by the *presence* of `success`, not by its value (F10). C# has
// no undefined, and every JSON reader in the ecosystem has an opinion about what
// a missing field becomes. Whether that discriminant survives the crossing is
// the thing worth finding out before three more bindings are written against it.
